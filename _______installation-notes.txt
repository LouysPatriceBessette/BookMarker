To create that "fresh install", here were the steps: ======================== IT'S ALREADY DONE!

=======
    This directory was created using Jacques Lenormand React Boiler Plate : 
       git clone https://github.com/decodejacques/fullstack-dev.git some-new-folder-name

    Then, install it :
       npm install

    Then, install React-router-DOM
       npm install "react-router-dom"

    Then, the install Redux : 
       npm install "react-redux@6.0.1"
=======

Now steps to do:

1 - Just extract that zip into your brand new empty folder!
2 - Test the installation by running nodemon server.js. It should render an "hello world" page on localhost:4000
3 - Replace the content of src/ and /public folders with your project files.
4 - Enjoy coding!
